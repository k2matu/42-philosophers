# Philosophers
The Philosophers project simulates a classic problem involving multiple philosophers sitting around a table with a bowl of spaghetti and forks. The goal is to manage their eating, thinking, and sleeping behaviors using threading and synchronization.

Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.
Each philosopher needs two forks (one on their left and one on their right) to eat.
The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation or when all philosophers have eaten the specified number of times (if provided).


## Compilation
To compile philosophers:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:k2matu/philosophers.git
````
2. Navigate into the directory:
```
cd philosophers
```
3. Compile the program using make:
```
make
```
4. This will produce an executable named philo.

## Usage
The program takes the following arguments:
```
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
- **number_of_philosophers**: Number of philosophers and forks.
- **time_to_die** (milliseconds): Maximum time a philosopher can go without eating before dying.
- **time_to_eat** (milliseconds): Time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
- **time_to_sleep** (milliseconds): Time a philosopher spends sleeping.
- **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat** (optional): If specified, the simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten this number of times.

#### Example:
To run a simulation with 5 philosophers where each philosopher has 200 milliseconds to eat, 100 milliseconds to sleep, and dies if they donâ€™t eat within 500 milliseconds, use:
```
./philo 5 500 200 100
```
